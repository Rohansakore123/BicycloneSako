<h3>Motivation</h3>
The ratio of population to motor vehicles in most cities of India has reached unsustainable levels resulting in clogged traffic, air pollution, and reduced productivity. Bicycle share is self motivated project  to ensure cities can continue to grow without choking on infrastructure bottlenecks.


  <h3> Design Brief </h3>

      In india due to explosion of population number of vehicals on road has increased considerably which is one of the major reason for problems of transport and health issues . A bicycle share system which is specially designed for user needs of India is a network of bicycles and stations managed automatically underhuman supervison that allows user to make short trips conviniently and affordably Also a handheld application which allows users to search for nearby bike docking station and rent or share the bike.

  <h3>
  Literature Review </h3>
There are 495 similar operating programs for bike share in the world while India has only 7 of them despite of the huge population. Annual growth rate of such start-ups is 14% and more than 500,000 bicycles are currently deployed. With the increasing air pollution which affects health bicycle is an eco-friendly and healthy alternative  <ul>
<li>Young adults who are using bikes are 48% less likely to be overweight.</li>
<li>3hrs of riding per week reduces risk of heart disease by 50%.</li>
<li>29% of bike users reduced their automobile use in america.</li>
<li>Every mile pedeled rather than driven reduces 0.82 pounds of Co2 in atmosphere.</li>
<li>India has Fourteen in 20 most polluted cities in the world according to WHO (World Health Organization)</li>
<p><i>Interestingly, in India, cycling isn’t new as a mode of transportation. From children riding bicycles to schools, to the local milkman, cycles are widely used.

However, with the push towards motorisation, the number of bicycles on the road have dropped significantly. Now, with the launch of smart bikes or bike-sharing, commuters will have an alternative mode for last mile commute, which would also control pollution</i>.</p>

<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>This user study is made to help me streamline and prioritize product development milestones. It also determines user needs and marketing stategy. research the wide range of problems that could be solved by a distributed team of volunteers using human-centered design and open-source technology. </p>
<ui><li>Product development</li><li>User needs </li><li>Cornerstone content strategy</li></ui>
<h4>Survey</h4>
  <p>“Design is not about reinventing the wheel.” Instead of creating a new system or a platform for users to teach and show how it works it’s better to use an existing they’re used to.
  For Initial research I made a survey on survey monkey which helped me to analyze my assumptions and narrow down my research .</p>

<h4>Interviews</h4>
It was necessary to begin with the real human needs that made up this complex humanitarian crisis, so I decided to interview few people to get an understanding of the problem and needs for bicycle share service in India . About 6 candidates were interviewed who had at least some
knowledge of smartphones and are willing to use bicycle for covering smaller distances. We seperated our users based on three main  categories based on their usage of shared bikes.
The user in earch category seek different goals and features. &nbsp

<div id="research" class="container"><h4>Crowdsourcing, Searching, Reading Discussing<h4> </div>
<div class="container" >Google search and social networks were used to gather information about problems that people were experiencing on the ground across India. We wanted to understand what affects use of bicycle after segregatiing users into categories. For group of people I visited Decathelon sports fair and used some survey questions to broaden my understanding about pain points and requirements of users.I reached out broader community of the crisis and asked for their feedback: What problems are you experiencing on the ground? Rather than put together a formal survey and review responses programatically, the crowdsourced problem lists served as fuel for solution and reflection.

  <h3> User Persona Comparison </h3>
  <p>Primary persona comparison based was made on the insights gathered during  discovery stage; motivation, frustrations, computer literacy level, social media, and based on their primary tasks.
  Users were divided into three categories based on their relation with bike share. </p>

<div class="container"><h3>Research Insights</h3>
  <p> I came up with some qualitative insights after interviews , survey and contextual inquiry.This  information that I collected after user research  makes it tempting to implement something simple and repeatable </p>

<li>Maintance of bikes is important under human suervision</li><li>Traffic might promote or degrade use of bicycle since it might take long using bikes to office.</li>
<li>Indiscriminately parked bicycles are prone to theft.</li>
<li>People in India are willing to use bicycle share if it comes with convinient parking system.</li>

<li>Students in colleges and schools require this bike share.</li>
<li>Many people in India are interested in eco-friendly idea of transport.</li>

<div class="container" id="research">  <h4>Bicycle as subsidary mode of transport</h4> <p>Many cities around the world are trying to promote the use of bicycles in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It might not be possible for everyone in India to use bicycles considering the abouve mentioned factors.
Instead people can use it cover shorter distances like reaching nearest bus stop or metrostation. Placing bike station near other modes of public transport will serve for the best.</p>   </div></div>

<h3>Ideation & Conceptualisation </h3>
<p>When it comes to getting around town with ease, not all cities have the most environmentally-friendly options. Fortunately, more and more cities are beginning to support the use of green transportation. Providing public transportation is key, of course, as is the use of electric and hybrid vehicles. One of our favorite types of green transportation is bike sharing.There is most definetively large room for improvement in means of transportation taking into account nature, time,society, work.
  The idea is to  create a platform where user can get easy access to bicycles and use
whenever they  want and focusing on an idea of  Bicycle as subsidary mode of transport.

<h3>Solution</h3><p>A bicycle share project which will be network of bicycles and stations managed automatically
 underhuman supervison that allows user to make short trips conviniently and affordably
Also a handheld application which allows users to search for nearby bike
docking station and rent or share the bike</p></div>
<div  class="container">  <h3>Bicycle Stations and System</h3>
<p>
  To make bicycles availalbe to user anytime , anywhere its to good to have
multiple bike station across the city. Locations of these stations can be near
 public transport stops ,inside university, near industrial area or where major
number of offices are.
The locations to set up stations and number of bicycles
required can be decided by understanding footfall of daily commutetrs.

</p>
<ui> <li>Bicycle stations will provide security to bicycle from theft
</li> &nbsp
<li>Users can use bicycles as many time as they can.</li> &nbsp
<li>Bike stations should be within 4 kms from each other which makes easy to park back. </li> &nbsp
<li>Everytime user park in the bicycle  it will automatically change the lock
code of the bicycle</li> &nbsp
<li>One has to provide registered number of  bike and unique security
lock code will be sent to users phone to unlock the bicycle.</li> &nbsp
<li>Bike station will have a proper maintenence under human supervision</li> &nbsp
<li>While parking in the bike to station user will get a notification to give a feedback</li> &nbsp </ui>

<h3>Mobile application</h3>
<p>App for bicyclone would ease the rental procedure for users and will prove
benifitial to keep records of the trips and bicycles. Bike sharing relies on a system of self-service bike stations. Users typically check out a bike using a membership or wallet or credit/debit card. They can then ride to their destination and park the bike in a nearby docking station. Bike share bikes are comfortable, have integrated locks and cargo baskets and usually include gearing, fenders and lights that make urban biking safe and enjoyable.
</p>
<h3>Sitemap </h3>
<p>The sitemap could helps to think out loud by keeping the structure as simple as possible from both implementation and usage standpoints. With the help of sitemap, I could think of mobile app's structure overhaul. </p>
